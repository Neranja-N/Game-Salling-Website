				<font>League of Legends' first-ever animated TV series, Arcane, is coming to Netflix this fall, according to a new teaser trailer released today. It's the epitome of a teaser trailer, though, so don't get too excited. It's only 19 seconds long, but it does give us our first glimpse of the show since it was announced in 2019.</font>

				<font>A new, much drier rootin' tootin' map is hitting Hunt: Showdown. <br>
					Crytek's criminally underrated 2018 bayou royale has been sitting at two maps since launch, but this new map adds a slightly different flavour from the other two swampy landscapes. There's a whole lot to take in for just a two-minute trailer, and it seems like Crytek threw in a bunch of small nods to the direction the new map is going to take. </font>

				<p><b>Days Gone is another success for Playstation on PC</b></p>
				<font>Although Days Gone on PC launched to middling reviews—Andy gave it a 63 when he took a look—it had a fairly strong launch week. It was the best-selling game on Steam that week, with 27,450 concurrent players over the weekend and a 92% positive rating.

				This still wasn't quite enough to outperform Sony's other PC venture, Horizon Zero Dawn (thanks, VG24/7). Despite being a much worse port—with poor performance and crashes causing the game to initially launch to mixed Steam reviews—Horizon had almost double the players around its launch week. It hit a concurrent peak of 56,557 in its first few days, though took a pretty steep nosedive after. </font>

				<font>Last year, Ubisoft was the subject of numerous allegations of workplace abuse that included physical assault and sexual harassment. Along with specific incidents, the company was accused of harboring a culture in which sexism, overwork, and misconduct were normal. Multiple executives resigned as a result of the allegations, including vice president Maxime Beland. Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot promised "profound" changes at the company. A year later, a number of fans don't believe that Ubisoft has kept that promise.</font>

				<font>Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto games may feature guns, crimes, and antiheroes in equal measure, but those games are also all about music. The GTA series has regularly featured some of the best soundtracks in games, and its iconic radio stations and bumpin' dance clubs means players aren't just submerged in violent heists, high speed chases, and gun battles with the cops, but a world of music, too.
					<br>
				Fitting then that Rockstar Games has announced the creation of a new record label. The new label, called CircoLoco Records, will release its first album called Monday Dreamin' on July 9.</font>
